Transformation from original dataset:
-------------------------
* subjects_train, y_train and X_train merged in only one data frame ( train )

* subjects_test, y_test and X_test merged in only one data frame ( test )

* X as result of merging the rows of *train* and *test*

* Filter columns of data frame X, regarding expressions "mean()" or "std()" ( vector selected with column names filtered )

* generate new column ActivityBySubject as "Activity.Subject" ( Activity = description of activity )

* Data frame melted by ActivityBySubject

* Mean calculated over melted data frame, by ActivityBySubject and Columns in vector selected
